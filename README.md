# Final Project

## Description
---
The goal of the game is to make it through the five levels of the dungeon by collecting crystals and
answering riddles. 

The game will comprise of five different levels with various platforms. The player will go around the 
platforms collecting crystals until they have enough to challenge the riddlemaster. You also can collect
coins throughout the levels for points. Brnonze coins are worth 1 point, silver 3 points, gold 5 points, crystals are
fifteen points. The player will then present their crystals to the riddlemaster who will then ask a question. Once  
the correct solution is selected the player moves on to the next level. Here's the catch though, the player only 
has five lives, and each time they answer a question wrong, they lose a life. If you fall in to a trap you lose a 
life and points off your score. When your life total hits zero, it's game over. 

What say you? Do you have what it takes to delve into the dungeon of V?
