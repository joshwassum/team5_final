# Final Project

## Description
---
The goal of the game is to make it through the five levels of the dungeon by collecting coins and
answering questions. 

The game will comprise of five different levels with various platforms. The player will go around the 
platforms collecting coins until they have enough to challenge the riddlemaster. The player will then
present their coins to the riddlemaster who will then ask a question. Once the correct solution is selected
the player moves on to the next level. Here's the catch though, the player only has five lives, and each time 
they answer a question wrong, they lose a life. When your life total hits zero, it's game over. 

What say you? Do you have what it takes to delve into the dungeon of V?
